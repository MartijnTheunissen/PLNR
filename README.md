Why
----------
Time is scarce. Making a planning for your responsibilities, tasks and deadlines takes effort. You will have more free time letting this software do the work.<br>
**Plnr** is designed to provide you with an organized and intelligent planning in a fast and easy manner.<br>
Furthermore the software can be used like any other calendar application.

Functionality
----------
- Loading and saving calendars in ICal format and tasks in a custom XML format.

- Good looking GUI that is easy to use.
    * Weekview, Listview and Taskview
    * Drag and drop of calendaritems in the WeekView

- Planning without conflicts avoiding calendaritems from multiple calendars.

- Generating a planning as soon as possible, as late as possible or as spread out as much as possible.

- The planning respects the deadline, duration and priority of tasks.

- Various settings
    * Multiple languages (English and Dutch for now)
    * Multiple timezones supported
    * Plannable during weekends option
    * Daily plannable period selection (E.g. from 9:00 to 17:00)
